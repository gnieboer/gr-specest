/*!
 * \brief Estimates the absolute value of the spectral correlation density
 * \f$|Sxx^\alpha(f)|\f$ using the FAM.
 *
 * This first calculates
 * \f[
 * S_{xx}^\alpha(f) = \frac{1}{N} <X(n,f+\alpha/2) X^*(n,f-\alpha/2)>_N,
 * \f]
 * where < > denotes the time smoothing over a time span of \f$N=P*L\f$ samples.
 *
 * \param Np length of the first FFT (in literature usually denoted with N', see reference
 * below) \param P  length of the second FFT \param L  decimation factor (must be smaller
 * than Np/4) Parameters all have to be multiples of two.
 *
 * \b Function:
 * The estimator works on input streams of complex samples.
 * In a first step, the channelizer computes complex demodulates \f$X(n,f)\f$
 * based on the number of Np samples per input.
 * In the second step, the spectral correlation and time smoothing is done and
 * the output is generated. The spectral correlation
 * \f$X(f+\alpha/2)X^*(f-\alpha/2)\f$ is based on time smoothing of P=N/L
 * complex demodulates.
 * \f$f_s\f$ is the normalised sampling rate; \f$-0.5 \leq f_s \leq 0.5\f$.
 *
 * \b Output:
 * \f$|Sxx^\alpha(f)|\f$ is a 2-dimensional matrix with dimensions 2N x 2Np.
 * The output matrix is sliced in 2N vector items, where the first item
 * contains the f-vector at the frequency \f$f=-f_s/2\f$.
 * The last item contains the f-vector at the frequency \f$f=f_s/2\f$.
 * The \f$\alpha\f$-vector starts at the frequency \f$\alpha = -f_s\f$ and ends
 * at frequency \f$\alpha = f_s(1-1/N)\f$.
 *
 * \b Note:
 * The first FFT uses a Hamming window and the products of the time smoothing
 * (2nd FFT) a rectangular window.
 *
 * \b References:
 * The FFT Accumulation Method (FAM) is described in
 * "Computationally Efficient Algorithms for Cyclic Spectral Analysis"
 * by Roberts, R.S.;   Brown, W.A.;   Loomis, H.H., Jr.
 * in: Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE Apr 1991 Vol 8(2)
