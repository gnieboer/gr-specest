 * \brief Estimate spectral density Sxx(w) using Welch's method.
 *
 * The estimator works on complex input signals. If \p overlap is left unspecified or -1,
 * a 50% overlap is calculated. The standard window is a Hamming window, but can be
 * changed to be anything else. The output is vector containing the moving average of the
 * last \p ma_len overlapping, windowed periodograms signal segments. The first element is
 * Sxx(0), then goes up to Sxx(pi) and wraps around to Sxx(-pi) - unless \p fft_shift is
 * set to True, in which case the DC carrier is shifted to the middle. The sum over one
 * output vector multiplied by 2 * pi / \p fft_len is the estimated power in the last \p
 * ma_len blocks.
